Hi! This is a site where I occasionally blog about things going on in my professional life, and share information about conference talks I've given.

It's also a place where I mess around with code when I feel like I've been doing manager stuff for too long. So while exploring the site you might see partially finished experiments and short-lived changes to look and feel, and overall things won't be very polished or professional :)

If you want to get in touch, you can find me on LinkedIn and Twitter at the links below.
