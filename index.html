<h1>About This Site</h1>

<p>Hi! This is a site where I occasionally blog about things going on in my professional life, and share information about conference talks I've given.</p>

<p>It's also a place where I mess around with code when I feel like I've been doing manager stuff for too long. So while exploring the site you might see partially finished experiments, short-lived changes, and strange layouts.</p>

<p>Finally, I'm also using the site as a place to document things I've learned while on a personal mission to reduce the amount of plastic I use.

<p>If you want to get in touch, you can find me on LinkedIn and Twitter at the links below.</p>
