Welcome to version 2.0 of tinafletcher.ca! Wow, it's been a while. So many things have happened...

+ I had a baby and took a 9 month parental leave
+ When I returned to work, I learned that I would need to do both my regular role as a software development manager AND act as a product manager for a few months, while a replacement was found for the full-time product manager that we used to have
+ Then there was a global pandemic, and the aforementioned child can no longer attend daycare, meanwhile husband and I are both attempting to work full time from home

So yeah, just a few reasons why I haven't focused much on my web site lately ;)

But besides all of that, the most important reason was that it was just a pain to deploy a new version of the site. One of my goals with the first version was to create opportunities for myself to write code... so I chose some very manual / "from scratch" ways of doing things. I think I've learned what I wanted to from that, though, and in this iteration I will focus more on leveraging existing workflows and tool sets. My hypothesis is that if it's easier to make updates or add content, I'll find time to do it more often.

I guess we'll find out if it's true!

Currently, I am using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate my website and it's hosted on GitHub Pages. I used some of the instructions in [this article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) to get started.
