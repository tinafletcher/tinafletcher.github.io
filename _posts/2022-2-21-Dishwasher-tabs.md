I've been buying dishwasher tabs from [Bare Market](https://baremarket.ca/); there isn't really anything too special about them, other than the store orders them in bulk and they'll ship you whatever quantity you specify in a paper bag. Otherwise, when buying dishwasher tabs at the store, they always seem to come in a big plastic bucket for some reason.
