I'm totally on the [Tru Earth](https://www.tru.earth/) train. As they say in their millions of (annoying) ads, traditional liquid laundry soap jugs are HUGE, and very heavy, and awkward to deal with. It's so easy to just toss a pre-sized strip into the machine, and I love getting space back in my laundry room cupboard.

You can buy these strips from many different places, including directly from Tru Earth.
